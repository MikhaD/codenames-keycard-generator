# Codenames Key Card Generator
This is a simple tool to generate custom key cards for the [codenames](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Codenames_(board_game)) board game.

## Reason for creation
My family enjoys playing codenames but would like to play with more than two teams, which requires key cards that do not exist, so I made this to create key cards of different sizes with more teams. All the variables are configurable in order to make play testing easy.
